        A comparison page, as the name suggests, is a website page designed to compare one product to another. It is generally used to showcase the differences between a service and its competition, and to highlight a product’s selling points against the competitor’s weaknesses.

        As regular consumers browsing the web, we use comparison pages to help us make informed decisions when we’re unsure of which product to buy or if we’re looking for an alternative to a tool that no longer satisfies our needs.

        It’s worth mentioning that comparison pages are also used as marketing funnels, so they may tend to overemphasise the quality of a service and weaken that of the competition. However, we can check the overall level of satisfaction with a product by reading reviews.

        The best 6 comparison page examples:

            <p class="paddedP">
                #Paid’s How it Works page stands out with its captivating visuals and a step-by-step breakdown of its influencer marketing platform.
                The page offers a comprehensive overview of how brands and influencers collaborate to create impactful campaigns. The presentation is a good example of impeccable text formatting.
                The main structure is realized with several lookalike blocks. Each block consists of a short paragraph and a relatable screenshot of the UI, which motivates users to try the platform.

        A forum and community website is a director portal for customers, users, and fans to interact on product-related topics.

        The content on these pages varies according to the company and product, and they allow users to communicate and participate in discussions to make it possible for them to address each other’s queries about the product and service.

        The forum also provides a way for users to get to know one another, interact with the company behind the product, and brainstorm new ways to use the app or service.

        There are multiple ways to set up a community forum for your website. The method you choose depends on what features you want to include, as well as the technology stack your site uses.

        We recommend using a self-hosted solution such as Github if you don’t want to invest too much time creating a community forum website from scratch, and don’t want to deal with all the technical-related issues that arise by running your own coded system.

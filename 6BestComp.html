    <h1 class="ZZZagolovok">6 Best Comparison Page Examples and Why They Work</h1>

    <div class="Textt">
        A comparison page, as the name suggests, is a website page designed to compare one product to another. It is generally used to showcase the differences between a service and its competition, and to highlight a product’s selling points against the competitor’s weaknesses.

        As regular consumers browsing the web, we use comparison pages to help us make informed decisions when we’re unsure of which product to buy or if we’re looking for an alternative to a tool that no longer satisfies our needs.

        It’s worth mentioning that comparison pages are also used as marketing funnels, so they may tend to overemphasise the quality of a service and weaken that of the competition. However, we can check the overall level of satisfaction with a product by reading reviews.

        The best 6 comparison page examples:
    </div>

    <div class="N1">
        <a href="https://www.sketch.com/vs/figma/"><h2>1.Sketch</h2></a>
        <div class="N1info">
            <img src="1-sketch-comparison-page@2x-680x510.png">
            <p class="paddedP">
                Sketch’s comparison page shows how it’s better than Figma. It focuses on stuff like real-time collaboration and design features. Using P3 colour profiles makes the page look good and easier to get around.
                The comparison page starts out with a nice, visual intro. It says Sketch is more than just an app for Mac. It was the original alternative to traditional design apps.
                User reviews say good things about Sketch’s intuitive interface, symbol controls, colour tokens and dark mode. Makes for a smooth experience.

    <div class="N2">
        <a href="https://ghost.org/vs/substack/"><h2>2.Ghost</h2></a>
        <div class="N2info">
            <img src="2-ghost-comparison-page@2x-680x510.png">
            <p class="paddedP">
                Ghost illustrates its product as a content management system and invites users to explore its features over Substack.
                The page presents a breakdown of how these platforms stack up against each other. Ghost chose a combination of generous white space with a clear font to ensure a comfortable reading experience. The structure is designed to guide users through each feature comparison step-by-step.
                The heart of the page are the table, and Ghost’s commitment to transparency.

    <div class="N3">
        <a href="https://usefathom.com/features/vs-google-analytics"><h2>3.Usefathom</h2></a>
        <div class="N3info">
            <img src="3-fathom-comparison-page@2x-830x623.png">
            <p class="paddedP">
                Fathom presents a clean and minimalistic comparison against Google Analytics. The key point here is the emphasis on privacy and intuitive metrics. Fathom’s page stands as an example of clarity and transparent communication.
                Sections are well organized, with each feature introduced through a simple header.
                The use of metrics, such as “Fathom Analytics is less than 2kb, while Google Analytics is almost 30kb,” helps users quickly feel the difference between the two products

    <div class="N4">
        <a href="https://slite.com/compare/alternative-to-notion"><h2>4.Slite</h2></a>
        <div class="N4info">
            <img src="5-slite-comparison-page@2x-830x623.png">
            <p class="paddedP">
                Slite’s comparison with Notion emphasizes its process in creating organized and collaborative documentation.
                The comparison page combines form and function, while breaking down each platform’s attributes, in their individual strengths. Slite’s minimalist interface becomes the canvas for focus. It’s a good example of how to incorporate sketches and videos on a page.
                Slite’s design is brilliant not only in structure, but also in empowering decision-making using the copy and calls to action.
